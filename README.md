# cloudformation-libsonnet

This repository is in experimental state. I am playing with cloudformation and jsonnet

Everything you need to know is in `taskfile.yml`

To install the dependencies run:
```shell
brew install go-task go-jsonnet jsonnet-bundler nvm wget unzip
```

To run a `task` run:
```shell
task generate
```

a bit of testing can be done in the test folder

# Todo
- [ ] need to understand how documentation with Docsonnet works [see](https://jsonnet-libs.github.io/jsonnet-training-course/lesson5.html)
